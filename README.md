# 🔐 Hybrid Cryptography System (AES + ECC)

A **hybrid cryptography system** that combines **AES (Advanced Encryption Standard)** for fast symmetric encryption and **ECC (Elliptic Curve Cryptography)** for secure key exchange and asymmetric encryption.

This project was developed as part of **Project-Based Learning (PBL)** for **B.Tech CSE (3rd Semester)** at **Graphic Era Hill University**.

## 🧠 Overview

This project focuses on securing multimedia data (text, image, audio, video, PDF) through a **two-layer encryption system**:
- **AES** (128/192/256-bit) → used for encrypting the main data quickly and efficiently.  
- **ECC/ECIES** → used to securely encrypt and exchange the AES key.  

It also uses **Base64 encoding** and **compression** to prepare data for secure transmission or storage.

## 🧩 Project Workflow

### **1️⃣ Data Preparation**
- Convert multimedia input into **Base64 encoded** form.  
- Compress and store as a text file for encryption.

### **2️⃣ Key Generation**
- Generate **AES key** (symmetric).  
- Generate **ECC key pair** (public and private).  
- Optionally generate a **QR code** of AES key for easy transfer.

### **3️⃣ Encryption Module**
- Encrypt AES key using **ECC public key**.  
- Encrypt Base64 data using **AES**.  
- Optionally encrypt AES-encrypted file again with **ECC** (2nd level).  
- Generate final **Cipher Text**.

### **4️⃣ Decryption Module**
- Decrypt AES key using **ECC private key**.  
- Use decrypted AES key to decrypt Cipher Text.  
- Decode Base64 to get back original multimedia data.

### **5️⃣ Data Recovery**
- Decompress decrypted file.  
- Convert Base64 back to original data format.

## 🚀 How to Run

### 🧩 Step 1 — Setup Environment
```bash
git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/hybrid-cryptography.git
cd hybrid-cryptography
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
🔑 Step 2 — Generate Keys
python src/keygen.py


This will generate:

AES Key

ECC Public and Private Keys

(Optional) QR Code of AES Key

🔐 Step 3 — Encrypt File
python src/encrypt.py --input test_files/sample.txt --output cipher.txt


Encrypts the Base64 and compressed input file using AES and ECC.

🔓 Step 4 — Decrypt File
python src/decrypt.py --input cipher.txt --output recovered.txt


Decrypts Cipher Text using ECC private key and AES key to restore original data.
